# Intuitive Math 

*Inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)*

A collection of mathematical concepts explained from first principles, focusing on building intuition rather than just memorizing formulas.


##  Philosophy

Mathematics is best understood when we grasp the *why* behind the formulas, not just the *how*. This repository aims to:

- **Build intuition first** - Understand concepts visually and intuitively before diving into formal definitions
- **Start from first principles** - Break down complex ideas into their fundamental building blocks
- **Connect concepts** - Show how different areas of mathematics relate to each other

## Getting Started

Each topic folder contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through concepts step by step. Open any notebook to start learning!
